# PHP PNG

Library for manipulating PNG files in PHP.

Implementation is taken from the PNG specification:

http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/iso/index-object.html

This library was primarily created to support the UoMCS Open Badges
implementation, so the functionality available is geared towards that purpose.
However, the library has been designed with the intention that it can be
used and extended in other projects.
